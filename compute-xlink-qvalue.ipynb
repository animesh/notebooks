    "  read from standard input.\n",
    "\n",
    "  FDRs are estimated separately for three different types of PSMs:\n",
    "  linears (including unlinked, mono-link, and loop-link peptides),\n",
    "  intra-protein cross-links and inter-protein cross-links.  The latter\n",
    "  category includes cross-links that occur both intra and inter\n",
    "  (so-called \"inter-intra\" cross-links in Crux).\n",
    "\n",
    "  For linear peptides, FDRs are estimated using standard target-decoy\n",
    "  competition.  Note, however, that in this case and in the cross-link\n",
    "  case, the estimated number of false positives is adjusted by adding\n",
    "  1, so the FDR is (# decoys + 1) / (# targets).\n",
    "\n",
    "  For the cross-linked peptides, the key idea is that every target is\n",
    "  accompanied by three decoys: one in which both peptides are shuffled\n",
    "  (decoy-decoy) and two in which a single peptide is shuffled\n",
    "  (target-decoy and decoy-target).  In this setting, the expected\n",
    "  number of false positives at a given score threshold is the total\n",
    "  number of decoy PSMs above that threshold minus twice the number of\n",
    "  decoy-decoy PSMs above that threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The program does the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "   o Segregate the PSMs into three categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "   o Estimate FDRs separately in each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "   o Convert FDRs to q-values via minimization.\n",

    "   o Merge all discoveries into a single list.\n",
